# Facial-Emotion-Recognition
I am working facial emotion recognition and the primary objective is to develop a machine learning model to identify the facial expressions. We are using deep learning techniques to classify the each facial expression into categories such as 'angry', 'disgust', 'fear', 'happy', 'neutral', 'sad', 'surprise'.
